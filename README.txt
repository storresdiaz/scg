To run the game import to your IDE as a gradle project by selecting the folder. Once imported, navigate to SCG-Desktop, open the source folder and launch the application using desktoplauncher.java.

PURPOSE : 

The purpose of this small project was to attempt to create an Entity Component System from scratch as well as work with data by creating an external scripting system. To add functions to the initial cutscene simply navigate to assets/data and modify the first cutscene text file to add actions to the game.

What could be improved on :

Making the Entity Component System more closed would be beneficial to avoid other objects from directly modifying attributes of any component. As well as creating block comments to help document the entire process.
